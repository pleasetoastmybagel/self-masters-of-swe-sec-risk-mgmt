# self-masters-of-swe-sec-risk-mgmt

Docendo Discimus

This is a project that I developed for myself. If you want, you can use it too. I designed it to document my learning adventure in tech.

This a self-paced and self-taught program that mimics a university masters program for applied cybersecurity; but with a real-world flair. This journey will entail learning and directly engaging with the target concepts through project-based learning.

The objective is to acquire technical security know-how in application security and an otherwise broad understadning of security's other domains. In addition, I will also incorporate gaining rudimentary skills as a software developer, IT practioner, and some leadership skills to round out my study.

Learning will be done with a three-step approach:

1. Complete a task: make, break, fix, or learn something–examples include making an application, discovering and reporting a vulnerabilty to a vendor, or reading a book
2. Bring home a souvenir: something that proves I did the work—ideas for souveniers might be documenting a conference with a blog post, or certificates for completing a certification
3. Show and tell: as in show off the knowledge and tell people: participating in a hackathon or volunteering my time to apply my new skills are some ways to satisfy this criteria

Once the program is done, all souvenirs will be collected and prepared into a porfolio on my soon to be built website. In addition, I will write a "thesis" that I will present to someone and to defend. This aspect of my journey is being clarified, so expect it to be beter defined later on.

Check back often for changes and progress.
