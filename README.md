Docendo Discimus

This is a project that I developed for myself. You can use it too.

It is a self-paced and self-taught program that mimics university programs, but with a real-world flare. I designed it to document and choose my own learning adventure in tech. Because this is an "applied" master's degree, it is heavily reliant on learning software engineering, cybersecurity, and risk management by doing. There's also a healthy dose of IT operations too; it's highly adjacent. 

The topics I'll cover include software engineering, cybersecurity, risk management, and IT operations. The goal is to be able to acquire skills chiefly within security, but also gain skills as a developer, IT practioner, and some leadership skills too.

More, learning also includes projects to test and widen my knowledge, reading various books, and attending conferences. This will allow me to both learn at and away from the computer, expose my work to others, and work on soft-skills.

More to come.
